<hr>
In order to add some security and give the access to appropriate resources,
depending on the role,
authentication and authorization filters were implemented. 

DAO layer has two implementations which gives you a possibility to test it both
on inner storage and on storage based on PostgreSQL DataBase.
Hashing and salting of user's password are implemented, so nobody has access to your secret data.
